What is React?
    - JavaScript library used to create websites
    - Allows us to easily create Single Page Apps - SPA

*** npx create-react-app <project-name> => this will create the react app for us with all the required files. 

Brief details on the files that are there on the react app:-
1. node_modules - all the project dependencies are here
2. public - all content that are public to the browser will be here
3. src - almost all codes, ie react component comes here
4. package-json : 
        - dependencies: lists all dependencies that are needed for the application
        - scripts: preview application in browser, local server


******************* REACT COMPONENTS *************************
 
1. the function App() can be an arrow function but the function name should be in Upper Case. The function returns
    whatever that is required to be put on that component
2. JSX - Syntax similar to HTML. Allows us to easily create HTML style template and in the backside a compiler called Babel
    converts all this JSX template into HTML and renders the HTML to DOM
    In JSX we can't use class because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript so we use className and when it is converted to HTML it becomes class
3. In the bottom of the react component(ie App here) we use export to export it to other files

{/* <h1>{title}</h1> */}
        {/* <p>Liked {likes} times</p>
        <p>{10}</p>
        <p>{"hello, all"}</p>
        <p>{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}</p>
        <p>{Math.round(Math.random() * 10)}</p>

        <a href={link}>Google Site</a> */}


****************** DYNAMIC VALUES IN TEMPLATES **********************

1. any valid javascript commands can be written in the function before the return statement
2. To include any javascript value inside JSX enclose it between curly braces {JavaScript ELement}
3. Variable of any type be it integer, array, decimal etc will be converted to string in browser but object and boolean won't
    be converted and an error would arise
4. Anything that comes inside {} inside the JSX will be treated as a JavaScript block


****************** MULTIPLE COMPONENTS ******************************

1. App component will be the first one on the browser followed by the other components - Root component
2. sfc - stateless functional component


****************** ADDING STYLES ************************************

1. inline styling in JSX -> style={{}}
    - the first {} tells that it is dynmaic value
    - second {} is for denoting tha it is an object
    - the property in the second {} cannot be things like border-radius, background-color it has to be backgroundColor, borderRadius 
        because it is a Javascript code
